# CornerNet: Detecting Objects as Paired Keypoints
* Note for paper CornerNet: Detecting Objects as Paired Keypoints [1] [corrnerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01244)

### Hightlights

  - Detect objects as paired keypoints --- top-left corner and bottom-right corner of the bounding box
  - corner pooling --- help better localize corners
  - one-stage method

## Introduction

  - A common component of state-of-the-art approaches is anchor boxes
  - Drawbacks of anchor boxes:
    * we typically need a very large set of anchor boxes
    * the use of anchor boxes introduces many hyperparameters and design choices.
  - a single convolutional network for predicting heatmap
  - a heatmap for the top-left corners of all instances of the same object category
  - a heatmap for all bottom- right corners, 
  - and an embedding vector for each detected corner.
  - embeddings serve to group a pair of corners that belong to the same object
  - Corrner pooling layer
    * takes in two feature maps
    * at each pixel location it max-pools all feature vectors to the right from the first feature map
    * maxpools all feature vectors directly below from the second feature map
- corner is easier to estimate comparing with center
- corners provide a more efficient way of densely discretizing the space of boxes

## CornerNet
- use the hourglass network as the back- bone network of CornerNet.
- predict two sets of heatmaps, one for top-left corners and one for bottom-right corners.
    * each heat map has the size of $$ C\times H \times W $$, where $$C$$ is the channels and is also the number of categories.
    * There is no background channel
    * Each channel is a binary mask indicating the locations of the corners for a class
    * instead of equally penalizing negative loca- tions, we reduce the penalty given to negative locations within a radius of the positive location.
    * Determine the radius by the size of an object by ensuring that a pair of points within the radius would generate a bounding box with at least t IoU with the ground-truth annotation $$t=0.3$$
    * Given the radius, the amount of penalty reduction is given by an unnormalized 2D Gaussian $$e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$. center is at positive location and whose $$\sigma$$ is 1/3 of the radius.

You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
